## Week 1

### Day first - [Single Number](https://leetcode.com/problems/single-number)
Given a non-empty array of integers, every element appears twice except for one. Find that single one.

> Your algorithm should have a linear runtime complexity. Could you implement it without using extra memory?


Example 1:
```
  Input: [2,2,1]
  Output: 1
```

Example 2:
```
  Input: [4,1,2,1,2]
  Output: 4
```

### Day second - [Happy Number](https://leetcode.com/explore/other/card/30-day-leetcoding-challenge/528/week-1/3284/)

Write an algorithm to determine if a number is "happy".

> A happy number is a number defined by the following process: Starting with  any positive integer, replace the number by the sum of the squares of its  digits, and repeat the process until the number equals 1 (where it will  stay), or it loops endlessly in a cycle which does not include 1. Those  numbers for which this process ends in 1 are happy numbers.

Example:
```
  Input: 19
  Output: true
```

>Explanation:
```
  1^2 + 9^2 = 82
  8^2 + 2^2 = 68
  6^2 + 8^2 = 100
  1^2 + 0^2 + 0^2 = 1
```

### Day third - [Maximum Subarray](https://leetcode.com/explore/other/card/30-day-leetcoding-challenge/528/week-1/3284/)

Given an integer array nums, find the contiguous subarray (containing at least one number) which has the largest sum and return its sum.

Example:
```
  Input: [-2,1,-3,4,-1,2,1,-5,4],
  Output: 6
  Explanation: [4,-1,2,1] has the largest sum = 6.
 ```

>If you have figured out the O(n) solution, try coding another solution using the divide and conquer approach, which is more subtle.
